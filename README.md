# Web Bluetooth - Serial Port Profile (SPP) Example
[![Version Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/v1.0.0-green)](https://bridgethings.com)

## Overview

This example application implements the client-side device for the [Bluetooth - Serial Port Profile (SPP)](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/bluetooth_applications/tree/master/bluetooth_serial_port_profile) and [Bluetooth - Secure Serial Port Profile (SPP)](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/bluetooth_applications/tree/master/bluetooth_secure_spp_over_ble) application examples and provides an example to communicate Silicon Labs wireless microcontrollers using the BLE protocol from the Web Bluetooth API [compatible browsers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Bluetooth_API#browser_compatibility).


![Overview](./docs/overview.png)

The application runs in the browser as a Single Page Application (SPA) without requiring any server-side connection.

## Compatible Bluetooth SPP Application Examples
- [Bluetooth - Serial Port Profile (SPP)](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/bluetooth_applications/tree/master/bluetooth_serial_port_profile)
- [Bluetooth - Secure Serial Port Profile (SPP)](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/bluetooth_applications/tree/master/bluetooth_secure_spp_over_ble)

## Requirements
- Install [Nodejs >= v22.14.0 LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/download) 
- Prepare and flash a development kit with one of the [supported application examples](#compatible-bluetooth-spp-application-examples).

## Getting Started: Run the Application Locally

 1. Go to [project-root-folder]
 2. Open a Terminal/Cmd/PowerShell/Bash there
 3. Install the dependencies and run the application with the following commands
    ```bash
    # install all dependencies
    $ npm install

    # development
    $ npm run dev

    # production mode
    $ npm run build
    $ npm run preview
    ```
 4. Open the application in a web browser
> [!NOTE]  
> The local address of the application is displayed in the console once the server is up and ready to process the requests.

- ESLint setup with [eslint-config-mantine](https://github.com/mantinedev/eslint-config-mantine)

## npm scripts

### Build and dev scripts

- `dev` – start development server
- `build` – build production version of the app
- `preview` – locally preview production build
- `deploy` - deploys the application to the GitHub pages

### Testing scripts

- `typecheck` – checks TypeScript types
- `lint` – runs ESLint
- `prettier:check` – checks files with Prettier
- `vitest` – runs vitest tests
- `vitest:watch` – starts vitest watch
- `test` – runs `vitest`, `prettier:check`, `lint` and `typecheck` scripts

### Other scripts

- `prettier:write` – formats all files with Prettier

## Troubleshooting

Sometimes, when the application runs in Chrome Android and tries to pair and connect to a new device, the application cannot retrieve the GATT Service. To solve this issue, try to Unpair/Pair/Unpair the device in the Bluetooth settings. 

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The device should be unpaired first to pair and connect via the application.
